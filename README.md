# MEDTRACK: Healthcare Analysis

MEDTRACK is a comprehensive healthcare data analysis project aimed at improving patient care, operational efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare systems. By leveraging **statistical analysis**, **interactive visualizations**, and **industry-aligned AI techniques**, the project provides actionable insights to healthcare professionals for better decision-making and resource allocation.

## üöÄ Overview

This project explores healthcare datasets to identify trends, correlations, and KPIs. It uses advanced analysis techniques and automation tools to streamline decision-making and highlight operational inefficiencies in the healthcare industry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data processing and analysis
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and KPI metrics visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration and reporting
- **AI Integration**: Predictive analytics for healthcare trends and cost patterns

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Statistical Analysis**
- **Univariate Analysis**: Explored feature distributions to understand variables like patient demographics, test results, and billing amounts.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Assessed correlations between variables, such as hospital stay duration and admission types.
- **Chi-Squared Testing**: Tested the independence of categorical variables, including medical conditions, test outcomes, and admission types.

### 2. **Power BI Dashboard**
Designed an **interactive dashboard** to visualize critical healthcare KPIs:
- **Average Hospital Stay Durations**: Insights into patient retention patterns.
- **Billing Trends**: Visualization of revenue and high-cost periods.
- **High-Cost Medical Conditions**: Identification of conditions driving up healthcare costs.
- **Admission Types**: Analysis of elective, emergency, and urgent admissions.

### 3. **AI and Automation**
- **Predictive Analytics**: Leveraged AI models to forecast trends in hospital costs and patient care.
- **Automated Data Processing**: Streamlined data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization workflows for efficiency.
- **Industry Trends**: Analyzed historical data to align operations with healthcare benchmarks and trends.

## üí° Workflow
